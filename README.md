# Scrappy

**Scrappy** is a desktop application built with **Electron.js** that provides an intuitive UI for web scraping. Designed to simplify the extraction of data from websites, Scrappy integrates **Selenium** for handling both static and dynamic content, including infinite scrolls and content loaders.

The core concept of Scrappy revolves around **pipelines**: sequences of actions that are executed step-by-step to automate data collection tasks.
